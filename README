This vmod provides cURL bindings for Varnish so you can use Varnish
as an HTTP client and fetch headers and bodies from backends.

Usage:

./configure

Make targets:
make - builds the vmod
make install - installs your vmod
make check - runs the unit tests in src/tests/*.vtc

To use the vmod do something along the lines of:

import curl;

sub vcl_recv {
	curl.fetch("http://example.com/test");
	if (curl.header("X-Foo") == "bar") {
		...
	}
	curl.free();
}

See src/vmod_curl.vcc for the rest of the callable functions.

Development of this VMOD has been sponsored by the Norwegian company
Aspiro Music AS for usage on their WiMP music streaming service.
